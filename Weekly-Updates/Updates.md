# Semi- Supervised GANs for Data Efficient Classification - Weekly Updates

**Team:** Poorva Rane, Goutam Nair, Anushree Prasanna Kumar

**Project Description:** We are working on using GANs to generate images of tissues and cells. We then leverage the learned representations and extend the discriminator to classify the tissue as cancerous and non-cancerous.
