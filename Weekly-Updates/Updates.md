# Semi- Supervised GANs for Data Efficient Classification - Weekly Updates

**Team:** Poorva Rane, Goutam Nair, Anushree Prasanna Kumar

**Project Description:** We are working on using GANs to generate images of tissues and cells. We then leverage the learned representations and extend the discriminator to classify the tissue as cancerous and non-cancerous.

This document contains the weekly updates on our Capstone project.

## Weekly Updates

### Sep 5, 2018 - Sep 12, 2018 (09/05 - 09/12)
All:
* Read papers on the variants of GANs in order to understand their implementation details.
* Did a literature survey on exisitng techniques used for tissue classification. 
* Explored publicly available annotated datasets for the project (<https://cancergenome.nih.gov/>).
